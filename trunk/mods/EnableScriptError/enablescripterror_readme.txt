Enables handling of script errors in TS3;

This reimplements a feature not present in release builds of TS3 which causes
TS3 to either display a script error window or save script error info to your
TS3 documents directory (Electronic Arts\The Sims 3) when an unhandled exception
occurs in TS3's scripts (Mono / Assemblies). It does absolutely nothing else.

Ensure that you have the correct version of this mod for the version of TS3 you
are running! Differences in version can cause problems!

This is a core mod that is incompatible with any other core mod which modifies
SimsIFace.dll.
